The response of the structures, subjected to different kinds of dynamic loading, can lead to very specific behavior. There are not many branches in engineering where vibrations would be as important as they are in aerospace. The main objective of this paper was the study of a vibration of a second stage compressor blade in the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbojet engine due to the blade tip-rubbing. Blade tip-rubbing is an event that can take place in the core of the jet engine during sever external loading. In pursue of ever increasing efficiency of the turbo engines, the tips of the compressor blades are rotating only a few tents of a mm away from the stationary casing of the engine. Under severe loading this casing, which is initially round, can deform in somewhat elliptic shape. This deformation of the casing can, in critical situations, be greater than the spacing between the tip of the compressor blade and the casing. This would mean that the blades would rub against the casing on two parts on the circumference, 180 deg apart.",

It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The flange region experiences a radial drawing stress and tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses can result in flange wrinkles. Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius. Many parameters influence the quality of a deep drawing. One of the most important is the force with which the holder is pressing the blank against the die during the process.",

With automatic remeshing, we could mesh the blank as very coarsely in the beginning. As the simulation progressed, the algorithm refined the mesh on the location where large strains occurred.

ALE-based finite element simulations can alleviate many of the drawbacks that the traditional Lagrangian-based and Eulerian-based finite element simulations have. When using the ALE technique in engineering simulations, the computational mesh inside the domains can move arbitrarily to optimize the shapes of elements, while the mesh on the boundaries and interfaces of the domains can move along with materials to precisely track the boundaries and interfaces of a multi-material system.",

We pointed our interest only to the Mechanical noise within this case study. Further classification divides noise to interior (cabin) noise and exterior noise. Interior noise is experienced by the driver and the passengers, while exterior noise accounts for the noise radiated to the surrounding of the vehicle. This noise is often associated with the \"drive by\" noise testing. From the frequency spectrum, the vehicle NVH can be divided as presented on Figure 1.",

Following the modal analysis, frequency response of the vehicle, under certain external load, is often required. Knowing which part of the vehicle vibrates, with what amplitude and at which frequency, gives us a valuable insight on the overall NVH characteristics.",
